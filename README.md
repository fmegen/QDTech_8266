# QDTech Arduino ISP ESP-8266 1.8 inch TFT Library

  This is a modification of the Adafruit SPI TFT LCD Arduino 
  library, customised to run Directly on the ESP8266 using hardware (or software) SPI for 
  the QDTech 1.8" 128x160 pixel LCD board that uses a Samsung 
  S6D02A1 chip.
  
  The initialisation sequence comes from Henning Karlsen's
  UTFT library

  Using the hardware SPI pins is highly recommeneded.
  
  Unzip and change the folder name to "QDTech_8266".
  Copy the folder into your
